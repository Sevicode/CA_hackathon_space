During a two-day Hackathon our team developed a small application so the users can easily search for information about asteroids, planets and moons. 

*Day 1:* During the first day we brain-stormed and planned for the project. Also started th primary stages of the development.

*Day 2:* The second day was all about coding and debugging. 

### User Stories :
* User can search for planet and be directed to the related information page
* When in the information page the user can click on *moon* and get some more information about that moon 

**Features**
* Search function
* Daily changes of background picture 

**Project Management**

* We used Trello to manage the project and staging the development in sections.
* The development process from design until completion was online and we used Canvas and Discord to communicate.
* We used *Git/Github* and *Visual Studio Code's Live Share* to cooperate and share the code 

### Tech Stacks We Used for Developing This Application:
